    <p>I am 16 years old and I attend Saint Francis Highschool</p>

     <p>Some of my personal goals include maintaining a 4.0 GPA and learning a lot more about computers</p>
     <p>Another one of my goals is to attend Berkeley College California</p>

      <p>One thing that makes me unique is that I ride motorcycles and it is something I would possibly look into as a career. I would love to be a professional Enduro Motocross Rider. One of the people that I look up to is Graham Jarvis, the 2012-2016 Romaniacs Enduro Race winner</p>

      <p>Another person I look up to is my brother. When I was younger, I always wanted to do what my brother did and I always wanted to be like him! This is him below.</p>
